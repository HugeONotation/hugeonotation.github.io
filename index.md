My name is Hugo. I'm a hobbyist programmer of nine years looking to enter the
field of software development. I received my bachelor's degree in computer
science from the University of California: Riverside.

My interests are in working close to the hardware, computer graphics, and
writing performant code, commonly through SIMD vectorization, but also through
GPU programming and multi-threading. I'm particularly fond of C++ and Linux
environments, although I also use Python and Windows when appropriate.

My interest in programming was initially motivated by a more general interest in
computer graphics. Writing small scripts and tools was useful for a project of
mine, however I eventually found that working on these was more engaging than
the original project. I initially spent a year or so on Java, but moved to C++
since it was more suitable for using OpenGL. For a number of subsequent years, I
focus on programming graphics. I further familiarized myself with OpenGL and to
a lesser extent Vulkan, using them to write some (frankly overly-ambitious)
rasterizers. I also wrote CPU ray-tracers, but I generally jumped between
exploring various facets of the field: from rendering theory to writing shaders,
from optimizing acceleration structures, to implementing procedural textures.

Around the same time, I also started familiarizing myself with the 3D computer
graphics application known as Blender. Over time, I found myself gradually
gaining an ability to answer the questions others would ask in Blender's online
communities. Doing this for a number of years earned me some recognition within
one of these communities, a community that was eventually entrusted to me. With
1.2 million members, it's one of Blender's largest online communities. Although,
I no longer focus on graphics as much as I once did, I continue to use my
knowledge of it to help 3D artists understand and make the most of their
software.

In working with computer graphics, I became increasingly aware of the importance
of performant code. This lead me to develop an interest in creating
hand-optimized implementations of various algorithms. I became fond of utilizing
specialized CPU instructions, particularly SIMD instructions, and leveraging
knowledge of computer architecture to maximize performance. In doing this, I
became familiar with the performance that modern CPUs can offer when programmed
well, but also with how little of this potential is leveraged in practice. This
inspired a certain degree of frustration, and a desire to better the situation.

More recently I've developed an interest in programming language design. It
seems likely to me that a well-designed programming language could allow
programmers to more easily use the full capabilities of modern hardware.
