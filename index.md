My name is Hugo. I'm a hobbyist programmer looking to enter the field of
software development. I received my bachelor's degree in computer science from
the University of California: Riverside.

My biggest interests are in working close to the hardware, computer graphics,
and writing performant code, primarily through SIMD vectorization. To a lesser
extent, I am also interested in other forms of parallelism such as GPU
programming and multi-threading. I'm particularly fond of C++ and Linux
environments, although I make use Python and Windows as appropriate.

My interest in programming was initially motivated by a more general interest in
computer graphics. Writing small scripts was useful for an artistic project of
mine, however I eventually found that working on these scripts was more engaging
than the project which motivated them. I grew to like the idea of developing
tools for the production of digital art. I initially spent around a year
focusing on Java, but quickly moved to C++ since it was more suitable for using
OpenGL. For a number of subsequent years, I focused on programming graphics. I
further familiarized myself with OpenGL and to a lesser extent Vulkan, using
them to dabble with the writing of rasterizers, alongside some CPU ray-tracers.
But I generally jumped between exploring various facets of the field: from
rendering theory to writing shaders, from optimizing acceleration structures, to
implementing procedural textures.

Around the same time, I also started familiarizing myself with the 3D computer
graphics application known as Blender. Over time, I found myself gradually
gaining an ability to answer the questions others would ask in Blender's online
communities. Doing this for a number of years earned me some recognition within
one of these communities, a community that was eventually entrusted to me. With
1.2 million members, it's one of Blender's largest online communities, and one
of the largest communities of 3D artists in general. Although, I no longer focus
on programming graphics as much as I once did, I continue to use my technical
knowledge to help 3D artists understand and make the most of their software.

While diving into computer graphics, I developed an interest in creating
hand-optimized algorithm implementations. I became fond of utilizing specialized
CPU instructions, particularly SIMD instructions, and leveraging knowledge of
computer architecture to maximize performance. In doing this, I became familiar
with the performance that modern CPUs can offer when programmed well, but also
with how little of this potential is leveraged in practice. These realizations
inspired a certain degree of frustration within me.

This has lead me to more recently developing an interest in programming language
design. It seems likely to me that a well-designed programming language could
make it substantially easier to write code that leverages modern hardware's
capabilities. Similarly, I believe it may facilitate the usage of patterns which
although powerful are cumbersome to use with existing languages.
